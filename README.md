# Article Search Python Program
For research assistant project! Simple Python script that gets the first link to a research paper found through Google scholar search (https://scholar.google.com/).

Dataframe is initially an Excel sheet converted to csv with two columns, Name and Link. The program returns a new csv file with the updated list with links. I used the BeautifulSoup Python library for webscraping and parsing HTML page.
